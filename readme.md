# Disposable_notepad
  These are just interesting thoughts that may be useful to me later.
#====================================================================
  The example is based on the Vernam Cipher
  A cipher is a type of one-time pad cryptosystem.
  It uses the boolean XOR function.
#====================================================================
  The novelty of the proposed solution concerns the method of generating one-time
  notebooks, for which the coordinates of the attractor trajectory are used
  Lorenz at a considerable distance from his starting point.
#====================================================================
  One-time notepad is generated dynamically for what it is used
  unique origin value and number of steps (points
  trajectories). The principle of operation of the proposed algorithm is presented below.
  When developing a regular algorithm, the choice of coordinates for the formation
  the cipher pad can be arbitrarily complicated, for example by using
  multiple trajectories.
